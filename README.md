<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Achievement Tracker is an app designed for creating and tracking achievements for games or activities. It was designed for my capstone project at Nashville Software School, but I made this app because it's something that I wanted to use myself. In the app, you can add games, whether it be video games, board games, or even activities if you want. Then you can add achievements or goals for those games that you want to achieve. Once you complete them, you can mark them as so within the app, so that you can try to complete all of your achievements!

### Built With
